## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Spotify Friend Recommendations

One of the best features of Spotify is how social it is with the ability to follow your friends, see what they're listening to, and easily share playlists. Additionally, Spotify has robust algorithms used to create recommended playlists based on individual preferences. For my senior design project I plan to combine these features to make it easier to share music recommendations with friends. I will create a web application to generate customized playlists for Spotify users based on the music their friends are listening to.

Spotify has a large collection of personalized playlists already-- Discover Weekly, Release Radar, Daily Mix, etc. The application will use a similar algorithm to create a playlist consisting of songs chosen from another user’s public playlists. This project will involve using the Spotify Web API to access a user’s profile and preferences, as well as creating the user interface for the web app.
