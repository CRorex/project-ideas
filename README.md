## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Survival iOS app
This project will create an iOS app that is level based. The objective of the app is to avoid obstacles by tilting a player around a map with a limited number of lives. This app will utilize the tilt features of iOS development and will require basic object interactions. While the first game mode will consist of a basic survival playstyle where losing all lives requires starting over at level 1, different game modes can then be built out from this.

Development of this app will not require sophisticated background design and should focus on smooth playthrough with difficult but rewarding levels which are creative and unique. By the end of this development, a strong understanding of tilt mechanics within iOS, the in-game physics, and basic object design will be required to create the final product. Development of this project would be most effective with 3 or less members.

## Project Idea: ML Model Generator Interface

This project will build an interface with the Vanderbilt TV News Archive that will allow for the creation and training of AI (primarily machine learning) models. Primary component will consist of a python based program utilizing at least PyTorch and Scikit Learn if not additionally Tensorflow, and possibly other deep learning frameworks. This program recieve the following parameters: Task category (classificaiton, regression, etc.), task target (classifying segment type, generating captions for audio, etc.) model structure and training parameters.

Once model creation has been tested and is functional, additional time will be spent adding additional options for model creation, as well as developing a django based API for requesting and sending models.
