## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python.

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: HeartbreAKA Website Phase 2

Every year, the Elegant Eta Beta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. has hosted a date auction event where attendees can donate money and art supplies to receive AKA dollars which can be used to bid on the bachelors during the event. Due to COVID, the chapter can not hold their event in person this year. Therefore, they wanted a website to be built that could be used to facilitate gathering donations and hosting the live auction.

Last semester, the website was built to their standards. However, the current state of the website requires that someone with coding experience would need to know how to change anything on the website. That is the goal for this semester! As a team, we would work  to create a localized database structure that could serve as a place to store all the data that is currently hardcoded in the website (i.e. text and pictures). We would also work to create a UI that can allow for a future member of the chapter to change the contents of the website. In addition to that, we will work on implementing a way for the colors and layout of the website to be changed based on their preference. This project will be a great opportunity to learn new skills in website design and database management.
