## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

Project idea: Web Scraping and Price Analysis (Title will be more fleshed put once product is decided)

An application that will show competitive prices for a certain product. These prices will be obtained through some form of web scraping and displaying the data on the site, as well as in the database. 

The idea behind this project is to create an application that functions as a hub or a "one stop shop" for a certain product. This will contain pertinent information to the user, such as the price of the product. This project is vague at the moment because there are numerous options for what the product can be (including shoes, clothes, textbooks, etc). Deciding on this product will come with more research on what websites allow scraping, to be extremely careful on what is done.

An example of the product is shoes. Say someone is looking for shoes from FootLocker, Finish Line & EastBay. Scraping the product pages from these websites will allow for the data, such as price, to be obtained and displayed on the website. With this website, users can look in one spot and compare prices from different competitors, lessoning the hassle of visiting many different websites to see prices and important information.
