## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Your Project Title Here [Don't Edit]

This project will address the difficulties that students face in buying and selling college textbooks. Used textbooks are sold at meager 20%-30% discounts from publishing houses and bought back at 60-70% discounts, revelaing a large profit margin that could be returned to students by removing the monopolistic grip that publishers hold over this market.
This project would establish a marketplace for buyers and sellers to transact, in hopes of helping both parties, and lessening the assymetric information gap that publishers leverage and exploit. 

The platform would require students to validate their identity with their email address and phone number. When submitting a bid or an ask, the students would have to specify the course, the book name, author, and volume/edition, the desired/existing condition, a few pictures of the book in the case of an ask, and the price of the bid/ask. Upon placement of a bid/ask, the publishers of an existing listings would be notified via email/text of the bid/ask details, regardless of if the request falls within their acceptable margins, to facilitate negotiation and exchange. The application wouldn't be responsible for the negotiation process or the financial transaction, as those responsibilities would fall on text/message/social media apps and cash/check/online payment apps, respectively.
