## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

# All Project Ideas Down Here

My software project idea is to add and/or extend some functionalities of Vanderbilt’s Your Enrollment Services (YES) site. This can be done through the use of a Google Chrome extension which students can choose to install or, for better accessibility, an integrated widget which launches specified “extra” functionalities. I see this project as a way to learn more about web integration and containers while also potentially helping out future Vanderbilt students during course registration.

A widget display popup in the Student Registration section could allow students to see useful resources, such as their degree audits or weekly schedule based on enrolled and/or in-cart courses, while browsing for courses. Another useful resource that once existed as a Chrome extension for YES, the Rate My Professor extension which displayed professors’ ratings according to RMP next to their names under courses, could be remade and reintegrated. These functions could be created and extended to YES through use of Java/JS.
