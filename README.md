## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

Roguelikes are a genre of role-playing games with a long history, and they are known for characteristics like high degree of randomness in the generation of levels, permanent character loss with little inheritance between playthroughs, emergent gameplay due to systems interacting with each other, and a focus on management of limited resources in the form of randomly generated items (both permanent equipments and single-use items). In addition, they are often turn-based, set in an enclosed "dungeon" setting (courtesy of DND campaigns, one of their main inspirations) and features tile-based ASCII graphics. My idea is to create such a game but with a highly integrated crafting and equipment-customization system, with enhanced ASCII based graphics, modernized UI, and cross-platform support.

In this idea, instead of generating items with unidentified but unchanging purpose, raw materials would be generated in the map instead. The player would need to find or construct crafting stations to make raw materials into equipments and single-use items useful for survival and progression. The said equipments would be highly modular, and spending more materials to enhance, modify and add new attributes to existing equipments would be the main form of progression in this game. Crafting and modifying of equipments require recipes which can be character innate, found through progression in the form of randomly generated blueprints, or discovered via consuming raw materials and enemy drops.
