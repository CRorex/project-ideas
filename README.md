## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Tinder Meets Netflix

 This project will build an application for users to help figure out what to watch on netflix or other streaming services with your friends. How this application works is you group up with the friends you want to watch with, in the group you select which streaming services you have available to check from, then you just swipe on movies until you all match on one together to watch. 
 
 This will help get rid of the struggle of trying to figure out what yo uall want to watch on different streaming services. This will also have some features such as allowing you to check genres you want and dont want to watch. You can have a friends list to make it easy to group with your friends when you want, and can see a history of past movies watched.
