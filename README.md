## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Public Speaking Skills Enhancer

This project will build an application for users to practice their public speaking skills. The implementation of this application could change, but it is currently planned to be implemented using various Amazon Web Services tools including Amazon Transcribe, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and Amazon Comprehend, etc. The user will speak to the device (phone, computer, etc.) for practice and this application will highlight possible fixes to enhance your public speaking. 

Some of the highlights will include identification of user customized keywords such as "umm", "uhh", and "like", analysis of both long and short pauses, and calculation of the tempo of the overall speech. The application will allow users to analyze both live and recorded speeches. The application will first display the transcribed speech with highlighted possible fixes and allow comparisons to other users/famous public speakers. Further development of this application could include identification of the tone and the volume of the speeches.
