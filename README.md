## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python.

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## HeartbreAKA Website Phase 2
Every year, the Elegant Eta Beta Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. has hosted a date auction event where attendees can donate money and art supplies to receive AKA dollars which can be used to bid on the bachelors during the event. Due to COVID, the chapter can not hold their event in person this year. Therefore, they wanted a website to be built that could be used to facilitate gathering donations and hosting the live auction.

Last semester, the website was built to their standards. However, the current state of the website requires that someone with coding experience would need to know how to change anything on the website. That is the goal for this semester! As a team, we would work  to create a localized database structure that could serve as a place to store all the data that is currently hardcoded in the website (i.e. text and pictures). We would also work to create a UI that can allow for a future member of the chapter to change the contents of the website. In addition to that, we will work on implementing a way for the colors and layout of the website to be changed based on their preference. This project will be a great opportunity to learn new skills in website design and database management.

## Crafting-centric roguelike
Roguelikes are a genre of role-playing games with a long history, and they are known for characteristics like high degree of randomness in the generation of levels, permanent character loss with little inheritance between playthroughs, emergent gameplay due to systems interacting with each other, and a focus on management of limited resources in the form of randomly generated items (both permanent equipments and single-use items). In addition, they are often turn-based, set in an enclosed "dungeon" setting (courtesy of DND campaigns, one of their main inspirations) and features tile-based ASCII graphics. My idea is to create such a game but with a highly integrated crafting and equipment-customization system, with enhanced ASCII based graphics, modernized UI, and cross-platform support.

In this idea, instead of generating items with unidentified but unchanging purpose, raw materials would be generated in the map instead. The player would need to find or construct crafting stations to make raw materials into equipments and single-use items useful for survival and progression. The said equipments would be highly modular, and spending more materials to enhance, modify and add new attributes to existing equipments would be the main form of progression in this game. Crafting and modifying of equipments require recipes which can be character innate, found through progression in the form of randomly generated blueprints, or discovered via consuming raw materials and enemy drops. 

## Survival iOS app
This project will create an iOS app that is level based. The objective of the app is to avoid obstacles by tilting a player around a map with a limited number of lives. This app will utilize the tilt features of iOS development and will require basic object interactions. While the first game mode will consist of a basic survival playstyle where losing all lives requires starting over at level 1, different game modes can then be built out from this.

Development of this app will not require sophisticated background design and should focus on smooth playthrough with difficult but rewarding levels which are creative and unique. By the end of this development, a strong understanding of tilt mechanics within iOS, the in-game physics, and basic object design will be required to create the final product. Development of this project would be most effective with 3 or less members.

## Project Idea: ML Model Generator Interface

This project will build an interface with the Vanderbilt TV News Archive that will allow for the creation and training of AI (primarily machine learning) models. Primary component will consist of a python based program utilizing at least PyTorch and Scikit Learn if not additionally Tensorflow, and possibly other deep learning frameworks. This program recieve the following parameters: Task category (classificaiton, regression, etc.), task target (classifying segment type, generating captions for audio, etc.) model structure and training parameters.

Once model creation has been tested and is functional, additional time will be spent adding additional options for model creation, as well as developing a django based API for requesting and sending models.
